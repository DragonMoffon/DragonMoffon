Hi! I'm **DragonMoffon**, a New Zealand based programmer, game designer, and research student operating out of the University of Auckland. I've made significant contributions to [Python Arcade](https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade), a game library for Python, and the upcoming rhythm game project [Charm](https://github.com/pythonarcade/CharmGame). I'm skilled in shaders, physics, UI design, and am overall an excellent problem solver and collaborator.
